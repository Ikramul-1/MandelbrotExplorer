A program that generates the Mandelbrot set and provides exploration features, like, paning around, zooming and also saving screenshots.

Note: If see that the file names of some of the images have typo, that is because I mistakingly kept a typo for the names at the function that is responsible for the images. So, sorry for that. Fix it if you want to.
